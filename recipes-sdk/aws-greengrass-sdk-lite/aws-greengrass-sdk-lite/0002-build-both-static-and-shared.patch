Subject: [PATCH 2/2] Build both static and shared libraries

This patch modifies the CMakeLists.txt to build both static and shared
versions of libggl-sdk, allowing packages to choose the appropriate
library type for their needs.

The shared library is built with proper versioning and both libraries
are installed with appropriate targets. The shared library uses default
symbol visibility to ensure public API symbols are exported.

Adds BUILD_SHARED_LIBS option (default ON) to conditionally build shared
libraries, maintaining compatibility with static-only builds.

Disables LTO for shared library to avoid Clang issues with alloc_size
attribute.
