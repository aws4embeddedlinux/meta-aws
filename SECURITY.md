How to Report a Potential Vulnerability?
========================================

If you discover a potential security issue in this project we ask that
you notify AWS/Amazon Security via our [vulnerability reporting
page](http://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/).

Please do **not** create a public github issue and any example code, if available.

Branches maintained with security fixes

See [https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Stable_Release_and_LTS Stable release and LTS]
for detailed info regarding the policies and maintenance of Stable branches.

The [https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Releases Release page] contains a list of all
releases of the Yocto Project. Versions in grey are no longer actively maintained with
security patches, but well-tested patches may still be accepted for them for
significant issues.
